Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.19,0:06:24.19,Default,,0,0,0,,It's true he was found in a similar position.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.19,0:06:27.67,Default,,0,0,0,,The first two victims are still listed with an unknown cause of death,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.67,0:06:31.80,Default,,0,0,0,,but Mr. Morooka died of an easily identifiable blunt force trauma to the occipital cranium.
